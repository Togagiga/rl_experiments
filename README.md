# RL EXPERIMENTS

An attempt at utilising reinforcement learning (RL) for a simple 2D game.

##  test_env and test_agent

- [x] Simple game written as environment (Input: [Action], Output: [State, Reward])
- [x] Simple agent based on Q-Learning with Experience Replay

## TODO: racecar_env and racecar_agent

- [x] Make the basic racecar environment
- [ ] Make simple agent: Current plan is to use a genetic algorithm

### Genectic Algorithm Basic Flowchart

## FUTURE PROJECTS	

- [ ] Use pixel data instead of "sensor data" for algorithm
- [ ] Experiments with different agent architectures
