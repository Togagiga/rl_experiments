An attempt at utilising genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL) for solving a custom environment.

## test_env and test_agent

- [x] Simple game written as environment
- [x] Simple agent based on Q-Learning with Experience Replay

## racecar_env and racecar_agent

- [x] Make the basic racecar environment
- [x] Make simple agent: Current plan is to use a genetic algorithm

#### Genectic Algorithm Basic Flowchart

## FUTURE PROJECTS	

- [ ] Use pixel data instead of "sensor data" for algorithm
- [ ] Try more standard Rl approaches for agent
- [ ] Try some hybrid of GA and Q-Learning/Policy Learning
- [ ] Compare agents
